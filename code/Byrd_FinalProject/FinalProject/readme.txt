Final Project Update

	I have been improving the classes in my engine and adding more as I needed and my prototype is looking more and more like the idea I had in mind. Currently you can move between the main menu, game, lose, and win states and I even added levels. The images and sounds will come after the mechanics are all working but I still have a long way to go. I still think I am making great use of my time because I've already found ways to make my code better.
