Final Project Update

	So My final project is finally done and I have to say I'm quite proud of myself. I'm fairly sure I've fulfilled all of the requirements and I think the game is kinda fun. Although at times it can seem rather imbalanced but maybe I'll refine the mechanics after I make the due date. I also changed and added a couple classes to the engine. For example, I modified the ButtonPure, makeButton, and input classes to add some customizable functions. I even added a Random class to handle a few quick random functions that I wound up using a lot. If I had more time on this project i would have definitely added some more sizzle to the graphics and mechanics but in the end I learned so much from building this game from scratch.
