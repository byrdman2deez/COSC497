Project 3

	I know I said the last project was was the hardest project I've ever had to do but this one takes the cake. The hardest part wasn't even getting the states to work. It was being able to fix all the bugs that came along with the newfound states. I would get one key state working and it would break all the other ones. 
	Also, the mosue was rough too because i tried to make an integer keycode for it to be used with the rest of the keys. It worked fine until i tried to press another key while holding the mouse button. It would get stuck in the press state and never come out. in the end I got everything working with the exception of the extra credit. I would love to be able to optimize this input system as much as I can though.
