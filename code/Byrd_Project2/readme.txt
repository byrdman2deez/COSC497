Project 2

	This project was quite possibly the most challenging project I have ever had to do BUT I managed to do it so I am quite proud of myself and I look forward to more projects like it. The easiest thing to do in this project was open it up and press f5. Eveything ater that was difficult, such as figuring out how to swap out one bitmap for another and deciding how to make different enemies show different bitmaps based on their color and direction.

	The thing that I failed at for a while was adding a new bitmap and removing the old one but i finally managed to get it down and complete the project without using sprites or the graphics property. It also took me a little while to figure out that i needed to use Display.game.addchild() in order to add the images to the screen. In the end I think I managed to accomplish all of the tasks and I learned quite a bit from it.
