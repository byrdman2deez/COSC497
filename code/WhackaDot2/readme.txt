Project 1

	This project was slightly difficult but rewarding because I got to practice with event listeners. The most challenging thing about this project was 
adding a penalty for missing a click. I tried to remove the event listener when the mouse entered a sprite and add it back to the stage when the mouse exited the sprite. It worked, but every time I clicked the sprite it could call both events anyway. I solved this visually by just doubling the score you would have recieved
if you clicked a sprite and subtracting half of it if you missed.

	I failed at solving the problem with adding and removing listeners but I managed to accomplish the task of adding a penalty. I learned how to draw a sprite from its center. I found out it was a lot simpler than I thought. I also learned how to scale objects smoothly and fade them out, destroying them over time.
