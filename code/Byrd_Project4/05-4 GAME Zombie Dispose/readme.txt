Project 4

	This project was actually one of the easier ones I've had to do. I was able to accomplish most of the tasks in one day. BUT the one thing that was difficult was including the console because i'm still not sure how to properly use it. The best part about this project was getting to see the engine start to work for itself. It feels good to have reusable code that can make tedious tasks so much quicker.
